## Monster card react-app
My first and the most basic react application on react. This is a simple application in which cards are beign formed on the basis of data fetched from the api and the fetched data is shown in the form of a card. Also it includes a search feature which filters the card on the basis of name you enter in the search box.

## Api's used
1. https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users for fetching the user data
2. https://robohash.org/${props.monster.id}?set=set2&size=180x180 for getting the monsters image
